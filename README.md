# chatterbox-client
This is a project I completed to explore client-server architecture. I built a chat client that allows communications with others on the same server. The project uses ajax to save (POST) and fetch (GET) JSON data to and from a remote server.

This project was done as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com) with a pair.
